## Description

> It started with a simple script to display a timer on the command line that dynamically updated.  Then printed out the final time and logged it to a file.  
> Now it will also time the execution of commands.  Not sure why this is useful, a timing wrapper could do the same thing.  The project just expanded slightly.
> The file created is called 'loggy.log'
